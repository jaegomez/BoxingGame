User vs Computer Boxing Game
The way the game works is that the user gets 3 options stats, punch or block, he picks one and then the game runs there is a 1/3 chance for the cpu to block the punch vice versa with the user it also subtracts one which ever amount of health points and 1 stamina every time a punch is thrown.
